From this page, you can select which lists to sync, configure calendar mappings, simulate synchronisations, and trigger manual syncs.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="Reminders Page Overview"></p><h3 id="sync-configuration" tabindex="-1">Sync Configuration <a class="header-anchor" href="#sync-configuration" aria-label="Permalink to “Sync Configuration”">​</a></h3><p>iCloudBridge can sync your reminders in two ways: Auto or Manual.</p><p>In <strong>Auto</strong> mode, lists in Apple Reminders are automatically mapped to calendars in your destination location. For example, if your have a list called &quot;Groceries&quot; in Apple Reminders, it will be synced to a calendar called &quot;Groceries&quot; in your destination location. If the calendar does not exist in the destination, it will be created. This is bidirectional - calendars in the destination which don&#39;t exist as lists in Apple Reminders will also be created.</p><p>In <strong>Manual</strong> mode, you can specify exactly which lists in Apple Reminders map to which calendars in your destination location. This gives you more control over where your reminders are stored. You can also leave lists unmapped, and these will not be synced.</p><h3 id="auto-mode" tabindex="-1">Auto Mode <a class="header-anchor" href="#auto-mode" aria-label="Permalink to “Auto Mode”">​</a></h3><p>In <strong>Auto</strong> mode, you can see a list of which lists from Apple Reminders will be mapped with which calendars in your destination location.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="Reminders Auto Mappings"></p><p>In the above screenshot, you can see that lists in Apple Reminders which have the same name in the destination location will be mapped together. Lists which don&#39;t exist in the destination will be created during synchronisation. So, for example, during the first sync a &quot;Private Reminders&quot; calendar will bve created in the destination location, whilst a &quot;Confidential&quot; list will be created in Apple Notes.</p><div class="note custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>If the reminder count displayed does not match Apple Reminders, remember that completed reminders are also counted!</p></div><h3 id="manual-mode" tabindex="-1">Manual Mode <a class="header-anchor" href="#manual-mode" aria-label="Permalink to “Manual Mode”">​</a></h3><p>In <strong>Manual</strong> mode, you can specify which lists from Apple Reminders map with which calendars in your destination location.</p><p>In the example below, the Apple Reminders list &quot;Work&quot; is being mapped with the existing CalDAV calendar also called &quot;Work&quot;:</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="Reminders Mapping Existing Calendar"></p><p>If the destination calendar does not exist, you can type in a new name to create it:</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="Reminders Mapping New Calendar"></p><div class="tip custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>Ensure you click the &quot;Save Mappings&quot; button after making any changes to your list/calendar mappings.</p></div><h3 id="syncing-reminders" tabindex="-1">Syncing Reminders <a class="header-anchor" href="#syncing-reminders" aria-label="Permalink to “Syncing Reminders”">​</a></h3><p>Before you run your first sync, it&#39;s a good idea to simulate the synchronisation first. This will show you what changes will be made without actually performing the sync. To do this, simply click the &quot;Simulate Sync&quot; button.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="Reminders Simulate Sync"></p><p>The simulation results will show you which reminders will be created, updated, or deleted in both Apple Reminders and your destination location. Hovering on any of the badges will also show what individual reminders will be synced:</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="Notes Simulate Sync Results"></p><p>Once you&#39;re happy with the simulation results, you can proceed to perform the actual synchronisation by clicking the &quot;Run Sync&quot; button. Once the sync is complete, you&#39;ll see a summary of the changes made:</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="Reminders Sync Results"></p><p>You&#39;ll also see an entry in the Sync history:</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="Reminders Sync History"></p><p>And that&#39;s all there is to it!
