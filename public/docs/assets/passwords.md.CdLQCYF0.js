This means that you need to carry out the sync manually. iCloudBridge tries to make this process as simple as possible. Here&#39;s how it works:</p><ol><li>Export your passwords to a CSV file from Apple Passwords.</li><li>Import your passwords export into iCloudBridge.</li><li>iCloudBridge sends any new/updated passwords to your remote location (i.e. Bitwarden, Vaultwarden or Nextcloud Passwords).</li><li>Any new passwords found remotely are imported, and you are given a CSV file to import into Apple Passwords.</li></ol><div class="note custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>One-Time Passwords (also known as TOTP, used for two-factor authentication) are supported, but only if you&#39;re using Bitwarden or Vaultwarden</p></div><div class="note custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>Passkeys are <strong>not</strong> synchronised.

You&#39;ll see results similar to a simulation, except this time the sync actually added passwords to Bitwarden/Vaultwarden or Nextcloud Passwords, and a file has been prepared for import into Apple Passwords.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="Password Sync Results"></p><p>If passwords need to be imported into Apple Passwords, you&#39;ll see a button to download a CSV file for import.</p><div class="important custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">IMPORTANT</p><p>For your security, the download link expires after 5 minutes, so make sure you download it!</p></div><p>Importing this file into Apple Passwords is easy.
