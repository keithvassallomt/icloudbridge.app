This guide will walk you through the main features of the WebUI.</p><h3 id="dashboard" tabindex="-1">Dashboard <a class="header-anchor" href="#dashboard" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Dashboard&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Upon logging into the WebUI, you&#39;ll be presented with the Dashboard. Here, you can see an overview of your synchronisation status, including the last sync time and any errors that may have occurred.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="Dashboard Overview"></p><p>To change settings and configure synchronisation options, use one of the navigation links in the sidebar. Here&#39;s what these do:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dashboard</strong>: Returns you to the main dashboard view.</p></li><li><p><a href="./notes.html"><strong>Notes</strong></a>: Manage Apple Notes synchronisation. This lets you choose which folders to sync and how folders map between Apple Notes and your chosen service. You can also simulate a sync or trigger a manual sync from here.</p></li><li><p><a href="./reminders.html"><strong>Reminders</strong></a>: Manage Apple Reminders synchronisation. Similar to the Notes page, you can select which reminder lists to sync, adjust list/calendar mappings, simulate syncs or trigger a manual sync.</p></li><li><p><a href="./passwords.html"><strong>Passwords</strong></a>: Manage Apple Passwords synchronisation. Here, you can manually perform a bidirectional synchronisation, or you can export/import passwords to/from your chosen service.</p></li><li><p><a href="./photos.html"><strong>Photos</strong></a>: Manage Apple Photos synchronisation. This page allows you to view sync status, simulate syncs or trigger manual syncs.</p></li><li><p><a href="./schedules.html"><strong>Schedules</strong></a>: Configure automated synchronisation schedules. You can set up periodic syncs for each service, specifying the frequency and time of day for the syncs to occur.</p></li><li><p><a href="./logs.html"><strong>Logs</strong></a>: View detailed logs of synchronisation activities. This is useful for troubleshooting any issues that may arise during sync operations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Settings</strong>: Access and modify your synchronisation settings, including service configurations and folder mappings - these are the same settings you configured in the First-Run Wizard.</p></li></ul><h3 id="settings" tabindex="-1">Settings <a class="header-anchor" href="#settings" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Settings&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The settings page shows you all of the configuration which was saved when you ran the first-time wizard. From here, you can enabled/disable services, as well as change any of the settings you provided during the wizard.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="Settings Page"></p><p>The settings page also allows you to reset individual services. For example, resetting the Reminder sync service will forget your Nextcloud/CalDAV credentials and list/calendar mappings, allowing you to reconfigure them from scratch. Note that none of your data will be deleted when you reset a service; it simply clears the configuration for that service.</p><p>If you want to start fresh, click the &quot;Complete Reset&quot; button at the bottom of the settings page. This will clear all saved configurations for all services, allowing you to run the First-Run Wizard again from scratch. Again, none of your data will be deleted when performing a complete reset.</p><hr><p><a href="./firstrun.html">&lt; Previous - First-Run Wizard</a> | <a href="./notes.html">Next - Note Synchronisation &gt;</a></p>',16)])])}const f=s(r,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
