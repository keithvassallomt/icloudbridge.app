It&#39;s function is to detect new photos you&#39;ve added in your photos folder (for example the one you use on Nextcloud) and to import them into your Apple Photos library. The idea is to facilitate keeping your libraries in sync. Here&#39;s a description of how this works.</p><ol><li>Bob takes a photo on his iPhone. iCloud syncs this to his photo library, whilst the Nextcloud app on his phone syncs it to Nextcloud (using the Auto Upload feature).</li><li>When using his Android phone, Bob can see the photos he took on his iPhone using Nextcloud.</li><li>Bob takes a photo on his Android phone.

Whilst the focus is Nextcloud, nothing really stops you from using any other sync service, as long as your photos are stored in a folder on your Mac.</p><h3 id="syncing" tabindex="-1">Syncing <a class="header-anchor" href="#syncing" aria-label="Permalink to “Syncing”">​</a></h3><p>From the Photos page, click Simulate.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="Photos scanning"></p><p>How long this takes depends on your Mac&#39;s speed and the size of your photo library.
